## Project 2 - Data Set 1

Data Set suggestion came from Sung Lee. He suggested analysis is to compare the schools to see which one had the highest performing ratio of exams with a 3, 4, or 5 and cross-reference with the location of the school.

Raw file is obtained from http://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

```{r}


if (!require('tidyverse')) install.packages('tidyverse')
if (!require('scales')) install.packages('scales')

#library(tidyverse)
#library(scales)

## Data Dictionary
From the data dictionary, field definitions are:
DBN:	District, Borough and school number		
School Name:	Name of school		
Num of AP Test Takers:	Number of students who took AP test		
Num of AP Total Exams Taken:	Number of AP exams taken by students		
Num of AP Exams Passed:	Number of AP exams passed by students


Some data exploration and tidying

Using summary() we get an idea of number of NAs, for example.

```{r}

# Data summary

summary(school)

```

There are `r sum(is.na(school$ap_test_takers_))` NAs in third column, `r sum(is.na(school$total_exams_taken))` in the fourth column and `r sum(is.na(school$number_of_exams_with_scores_3_4_or_5))` in the last column.

These need to be ignored, so a transformed data set is generated - school1.


```{r}

# Data summary
school1<-na.omit(school)
summary(school1)

```

I will also split column dbn into district, borough and school id, as line out in the data dictionary. I will also add a column containing the borough name.

```{r}
# District 
school1$district<-str_extract(school1$dbn, "^.{2}")

# borough code
school1$borough<-substr(school1$dbn, 3, 3)
school1$borough_desc<-ifelse(school1$borough=="M",'Manhattan',ifelse(school1$borough=="Q",'Queens',ifelse(school1$borough=="K",'Brooklyn',ifelse(school1$borough=="X",'Bronx',ifelse(school1$borough=="R",'Staten Island',NA))))) 

# School id
school1$id<-substr(school1$dbn, 4, 6)


head(school1)
```


## Part 1 - Analysis of AP test data set
As suggested by my colleague Sung Lee, I will compare schools to see which one had the highest performing ratio of exams with a 3, 4, or 5 and cross-reference with the location of the school.


Performing ratio has to be normalized by the total of exams taken. A box plot is showed for comparison. 

```{r}
# Normalizing performance ratio by total exams taken
#(school1<-mutate(school1, perf_ratio = paste(round(number_of_exams_with_scores_3_4_or_5 / total_exams_taken*100,1), "%", sep="") ) )

school1<-mutate(school1, perf_ratio = number_of_exams_with_scores_3_4_or_5 / total_exams_taken )

# Boxpplot
ggplot(school1, mapping=aes(borough_desc,perf_ratio)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_x_discrete(name ="Borough") + scale_y_continuous(name = "Performance Ratio")

```

Some Highlights:
Manhattan has the highest median while Bronx has the lowest.
Highest individual performance found in Bronx.
Highest dispersion of performance is found in Bronx.
Lowest dispersion is in Staten Island.

Summarizing by the mean and median of performance ratio and grouped by borough

```{r}
school2<-school1 %>%
  group_by(borough_desc) %>%
  summarize(Mean_Perf=mean(perf_ratio), Median_Perf=median(perf_ratio)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean_Perf),Median_Perf)

# ggplot(school2) + geom_col(mapping=aes(x=reorder(borough_desc,-Mean_Perf),Mean_Perf)) + scale_x_discrete(name ="Borough")+ scale_y_continuous(name ="Mean Performance")

```

Summarizing by the mean and median of performance ratio and grouped by district and borough

```{r}
# Summarizing by the mean of performance ratio and grouped by district
(school3<-school1 %>%
  group_by(district, borough_desc) %>%
  summarize(Mean=percent(mean(perf_ratio)), Median=percent(median(perf_ratio))) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean), Median))
```

Top 3 districts with highest means are all in Manhattan.

As suggested by my colleage, I'll display the top schools.


```{r}
school4<-school1 %>%
  select(dbn,schoolname,borough_desc,perf_ratio) %>%
  mutate(rank=min_rank(perf_ratio)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rank))

head(school4)

```

Top school is `r school4$schoolname[1]`, located in `r school4$borough_desc[1]`  with a performance ratio of `r percent(school4$perf_ratio[1])`.


## Additional data set 
I will also explore demography data related to each school using another dataset provide by NYC Open Data.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
demog<-read.csv(file='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ihfw-zy9j.csv')
head(demog)
```

Both data sets are linked by the DBN field, which will be a way to join them.

## Data Dictionary
There are just too many columns to display, exactly `r ncol(demog)` columns. Data dictionary location is here 

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/ihfw-zy9j/files/9e1aa617-1249-43ea-b7eb-2240bbed5b41?download=true&filename=Demographic%20Data%20DD.xlsx

Main columns I will be using are:
DBN	
Year	The school year
'#Female	The number of females
%Female	The percentage of females
'#Male	The number of males
%Male	The percentage of males
'#Asian	The number of asians
%Asian	The percentage of asians
'#Black	The number of blacks
%Black	The percentage of blacks
'#Hispanic	The number of hispanics
%Hispanic	The percentage of hispanics
'#Other	The number of others
%Other	The percentage of others
'#White	The number of whites
%White	The percentage of whites



```{r}
#Filtering by year of first data set

demog1<-demog %>%
  filter(schoolyear=="20102011")

#left join by unique key 
school5<-school4 %>%  
  left_join(demog1, by="dbn")

head(school5)
```

Top School does not have any demography data, but second best ranked has  `r school5$male_per[2]`% males, and located in `r school5$asian_per[2]`% Asians, for example.
